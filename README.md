# IBM
It focuses on common ecology/diversity metrics used in microbiome analysis, includes data simulation, real data loading & visualization, statistical testing, and diversity calculations on the real data. The main goal is microbiome data manipulation and analysis using Python.
It demonstrates common microbiome analysis workflows - diversity calculation, comparison across categories, correlation searches and focus on specific microbe abundance/prevalence across diseases. The goal is an introductory demonstration of microbiome data manipulation and visualization.
The code focuses on data simulation, visualization and analysis of microbiome count data using ecological distance metrics, alpha diversity calculations and dimensionality reduction methods. The goal is an introductory demonstration of microbiome data manipulation in Python.
